### Goal

To implement Kadane’s Algorithm in Java and find the maximum sum of a subarray.

---

### Description

The program goes through the array once.
It keeps the current sum and the maximum sum found so far.
When the current sum becomes higher than the maximum, it updates the result.
At the end, it shows the subarray with the largest sum.

---

### Example Output

```
Maximum Subarray Sum: 7
Start Index: 2
End Index: 6
Subarray: [4 -1 -2 1 5]
```

---

### Time and Space Complexity

* Time Complexity: O(n) — the array is checked once.
* Space Complexity: O(1) — only a few variables are used.

---

### Clean Code

* Simple and readable structure
* Clear variable names
* Short and useful comments

---

### Conclusion

Kadane’s Algorithm is a simple and effective method to find the subarray with the maximum sum.
It works fast and uses very little memory.
